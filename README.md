# GranCentral MVP Client

This web app uses [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify), with identity provided by [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login), to access the AWS Mobile Hub project [grancentral-mvp](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home?region=us-east-2#/4eb8b899-bc2c-44b5-b8b7-f925fd26e269/build).

As the first and broadest user of the MH project's APIs, this repository also stores the [API code](awsmobilejs/backend/cloud-api). In order to keep the backend in sync, be sure to use [`awsmobile`](https://github.com/aws/awsmobile-cli) to pull before editing, and push after editing / testing.
